# CONTRIBUTING

Welcome! I am really glad you like to help us to create a better world to developers.

So, now I only need make some points clear to avoid problems:

## I could reject your PR

Yeah, sorry about that. I am trying to not be that person, but in some cases, I can deny your request. 

I will write some principles I will use to decide that, and we can work together to avoid any misconceptions. Be free to suggest improvements here too.

- The resource language is not a problem, so you can add resources from any language
- When you open your PR you need to tell me why you believe that resource is relevant. I will try to read the resource, but I can't promise I will achieve that
- The resource needs to be about how to create a better developer experience, so other subjects will be rejected


I think that is enough for you to understand what not make sense here, but if you have some doubts about that, just open a PR and let's talk about that.
